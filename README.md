# Text-Mining-in-R
Code scripts for the blog 'Text Mining in R' which can be found here: 

Text mining performed in R using 'tm' package on Twitter data obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets/discussion/196297 
Performing sentiment analysis on tweets collected in the lead to the US elections in 2020 on Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and seeing if insights drawn match the actual outcome.

There are two R scripts: one for Biden's dataset analysis, one for Trump's dataset analysis.

NB: Code for sentiment graphs comparing both candidates in one plot can be found towards the end of *Trump's dataset*.
